# INF 554 Assignment 7

The data was taken from world data (http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&series=SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS&country=#). The countries were taken from assignment 1 and the metric was taken for the year of 2017  for percentage rural population of that country.

The aim of this assignment was to make an interactive bar chart with the help of D3.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap. 

The User can sort and filter the data. It has the following options.

Reset to intial data (sorted alphabetically)
Filter:
All 10
Top 5 by Value

A normal SVG bar graph was created as done in previous assignment. Later on D3.js was used to make usefull transitions and animations. 
1. Enter to getnerate a new graph or fill in new values.
2. Exit to remove redundant and delete data. 
3. Update to transition from one data point to another. 

Bootstrap was referred via it's CSS CDN. Buttons were stylized to have an aesthetic look. 

Later on the the webpage was hosted at (http://www-scf.usc.edu/~anmolcha/itp104/a7/a7.html).

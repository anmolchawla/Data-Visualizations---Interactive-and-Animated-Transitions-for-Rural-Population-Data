# INF 554 Assignment 8

## Description 
Assignment 8. Use the countries of Assignment 1. Load the data in JSON and implement a D3 bar chart complete with axes, tick marks and labels. Implement smooth transitions based on user input to reorder the bars: show all bars in alphabetic order (default), ascending order, descending order, top 5, bottom 5. Update the axes and legend as needed.

__GIT good practice__

To demonstrate good practice of GIT, do **not** commit your files to GIT after you are done with the whole presentation. Commit in a small chunk of work. For example, start with an outline and then commit, work on a few slides and then commit, make some changes and then commit, etc.
